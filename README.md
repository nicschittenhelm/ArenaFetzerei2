# ArenaFetzerei2
Immerse yourself in an arena-based shooter pitted against waves of AI opponents. The challenge escalates as you persevere through each wave. Your objective? Sustain your survival for as long as possible, contending solely against your own limits.

## Technical
The game is developed using Unity and incorporates a health system that manages the health of both the player and enemies. Enemies are equipped with clever pathfinding that enables them to consistently select the shortest path while avoiding obstacles. The gunplay mechanics rely on raycasting to accurately detect potential hits. In terms of visuals, the water within the scene is a procedurally generated mesh, with vertex positions being manipulated based on a noise pattern to create the appearance of waves.
